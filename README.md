## ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gregoria Rubio, from Paris, France
ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything basically, but trying to focus on being a **Fullstack developer** <br>
ğŸŒ± I'm currently practicing **Python, Flutter and VueJS in a serverless environment**, but also more random things like OOP, databases and best practices in architecture <br>
ğŸ“« You can find me on LinkedIn :  [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregoria-rubio/)
