## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gregoria Rubio, from Paris, France
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything basically, but trying to focus on being a **Fullstack JS developer** <br>
ðŸŒ± Most of the time Iâ€™m learning **React, Vue and Nodejs**, but also Typescript and more random things like OOP, algorithms and architecture <br>
ðŸ“« You can find me on LinkedIn if you want to contact me :  [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregoria-rubio/)
